                    <h1>A lil' something about Megan:</h1>
                    
                    <p class="blu"> 
                            Megan strives to learn a little something about everything. Raised on the Colorado Rockies, you can find her on alpine trails dancing like nobody’s watching. She finds inspiration everywhere, but especially in wild flowers. When the seed of an idea is planted in her mind, the stubborn nature of Megan’s brain refuses to give up, pouring hours into practice, persistence and perfection. In case you were wondering what Megan’s done on any given day since May 23rd, 2013, she can pull up a journal entry from any day from then to now. Within these pages you’ll find a drive for new skills and experiences that never sleeps. Whether it be coding, illustrating, painting, fly-fishing, growing a garden or cooking a mean ribeye steak, Megan is curious and eager to tackle challenges head on.
