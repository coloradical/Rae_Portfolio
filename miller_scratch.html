            Following the two-year production of a documentary showcasing the spirit of the open road, Camden & Spencer Miller (Miller Bros) prepared to submit their premier film “The Comfort Zone” to festivals across the world. To supplement their message of authentic and unique storytelling, I crafted colorful, organic illustrations based around the places visited in their blue Volkswagen bus, Lars.

    <h2>The Miller Bros requested a bright color palette that utilized flowers, mountains and other natural elements from their travels, as well as an organic approach to illustration to express authenticity. </h2>
    <p class="blu">The first steps of my creative process revolved around developing a sense of the environments visited in Lars. I could sum the majority of their travels to deserts, mountains, coasts and forests. These environments naturally aligned with their goal for eye-catching, colorful stickers to commemorate their travels. I researched the color of their Volkswagen bus and built color palettes off of this basis, and sketched multiple angles of Lars.</p>

        <p class="blu">I hand-drew over 20 designs to choose from showcasing different subjects and environments that I found within their footage. Some were selected as sticker designs, some are used as variations of their logo. </p>
